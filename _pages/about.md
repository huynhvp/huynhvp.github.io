I am currently a R&D AI Engineer at [Orange Labs, France](https://hellofuture.orange.com/fr/). 

- I'm particularly interested in <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b>, with a particular focus on <b>Large Language Models (LLMs)</b>.:
  - AI Agentic workflow design (e.g. Langchain, Langgraph, vLLM)
  - Question-Answering (e.g. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), GraphRAG)
  - Information retrieval, Semantic Search (e.g. using text embedding models, text search, vector search index such as Elastic Search)
  - Structured / Unstructured data annotation (e.g. Named Entity Recognition, Entity Linking).
  
<p></p>
- I like to develop and optimize APIs (e.g. Fastapi, Pydantic, Asyncio, MLflow, vLLM) to make my works accessible. I am a learner of microservices and distributed computing architecture (e.g. Docker, Ray).

- I mostly do Python. I like to write clean and quality code with poetry, ruff and mypy. I use gitlab/github streamlining workflows for CI/CD. When I write UI, I use Javascript (ReactJS).

- I also like to read and write academic papers, as well as technical blog posts.
