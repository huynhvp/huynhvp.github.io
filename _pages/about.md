I am currently a R&D AI Engineer at [Orange Labs, France](https://hellofuture.orange.com/fr/). 

- My research interest revolves around <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b>. I am particularly interested in studying transformer-based language models, prompt engineering and their applications in:
  - AI Agentic workflow design (e.g. React, OpenAI's function calling, CrewAI)
  - Question-Answering (e.g. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Llamaindex)
  - Semantic Search (e.g. using text embedding models, vector search index such as Elastic Search)
  - Structured / Unstructured data annotation (e.g. Named Entity Recognition, Entity Linking).
<p></p>
- I like to develop and optimize APIs (e.g. with Flask, Gunicorn, Celery, MLflow) to make my works accessible. I am a learner of microservices architecture (e.g. Docker, Ray).

- I mostly do Python (and started learning Rust). When I write UI, I use Javascript (ReactJS).

- I also like to read and write academic papers, as well as technical blog posts.
